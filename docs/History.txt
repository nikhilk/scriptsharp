v0.7.4.0
    - Fix/update bing maps metadata bug
    - Fix observable bug where access to an observed property without an observer
      registration would drop existing observers.
    - Remove /copyRefs flag from ssc.exe (script references are no longer copied to output folder)
      Same applies to ScriptCompilerExec task. The normal ScriptCompilerTask continues to provide
      this capability.
    - Added Sharpen.dom.js - a minimal set of helper APIs on top of HTML5 DOM APIs.
    - Some enum related changes:
      ToString/Enum parsing support removed (it didn't work for internal enums anyway)
      ToString on named enums (and on strings) skipped as it is redundant
      Inline enum values in generated script
      Skip generating internal enum types
    - [git #25] Importing multi-dimensional arrays
    - [git #56] Switch statement when used with more then 6 cases will generate a compile error
    - [git #62] Compile error due to assembly name sort order (with generic types being
                imported, assembly load order starts to matter)
    - [git #66] Support Nullable.GetValueOrDefault which is needed for ?? operator on
                nullables.
    - [git #67] BREAKING CHANGE: DateTime -> Date. Date is also no longer a value type.
                (partially fixes #67, and also makes Date more representative of script semantics
                which are not that of a value type)
    - [git #84] Raise error for code which calls Type.CreateInstance with the results of a method
                call/property access directly.
    - [git #92] Don't generate internal consts since their values have been inlined
                even in debug builds (for symmetry with release builds)
                Also, at the same type skip generating types for internal enums marked
                as Named/NumericValues, since their values have been inlined as well.
                Also fixes [git #42] indirectly.
    - [git #93] Error compiling cross-referenced projects in 0.7.3
                Fix by requiring explicit references, and reporting failure on not doing so
                instead of silent failure (this is temporary ... there must be a better
                msbuild way of including transitive closure of assemblies, but even
                referencing indirect references in the targets file raises an error to
                include explicit references).
    - [git #94] Raise error for code which calls Type.CreateInstance with the results of a method
                call/property access directly.
    - [git #96] Handle '+' unary operator
    - [git #97] Unable to generate code for projects that don't reference Script.Web.dll.
    - [git #103] Fix generation of custom delegates to use "Function" as generated script name
    - [git #107] ScriptAlias is not respected on types defined in the current assembly
    - [git #114] Window.ApplicationCache.Status.ToString() generates invalid JavaScript

                mode, and the only statement in source code is a debug-conditional statement.
