jQuery UI
===============================================================================

This assembly provides access to jQuery UI APIs. This is only meant for use at
development time, so you can reference and compile your c# code against 
the plugin APIs. You must include the appropriate plugin scripts in your page for 
runtime functionality.

More information is on http://jqueryui.com.
