Calling this method produces a hash that can be appended to any url to easily submit a new item order back to the server.<para>It works by default by looking at the id of each item in the format 'setname_number', and it spits out a hash like "setname[]=number&amp;setname[]=number".</para><para>You can also give in a option hash as second argument to custom define how the function works. The possible options are: 'key' (replaces part1[] with whatever you want), 'attribute' (test another attribute than 'id') and 'expression' (use your own regexp).</para><para>If serialize returns an empty string, make sure the id attributes include an underscore.  They must be in the form: "set_number" For example, a 3 element list with id attributes foo_1, foo_5, foo_2 will serialize to foo[]=1&amp;foo[]=5&amp;foo[]=2. You can use an underscore, equal sign or hyphen to separate the set and number.  For example foo=1 or foo-1 or foo_1 all serialize to foo[]=1.</para>
