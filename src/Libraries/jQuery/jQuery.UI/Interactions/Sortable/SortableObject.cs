The possible options are: 'key' (replaces part1[] with whatever you want), 'attribute' (test another attribute than 'id') and 'expression' (use your own regexp).</para><para>If serialize returns an empty string, make sure the id attributes include an underscore.  They must be in the form: "set_number" For example, a 3 element list with id attributes foo_1, foo_5, foo_2 will serialize to foo[]=1&amp;foo[]=5&amp;foo[]=2.
