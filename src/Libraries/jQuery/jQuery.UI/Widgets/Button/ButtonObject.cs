Its used by selecting a container element (which contains the radio buttons) and calling buttonset(). Buttonset will also provide visual grouping, and therefore should be used whenever you have a group of buttons. It works by selecting all descendents and applying button() to them. You can enable and disable a buttonset, which will enable and disable all contained buttons. Destroying a buttonset also calls each button's destroy method.</para><para>When using an input of type button, submit or reset, support is limited to plain text labels with no icons.</para><para>This widget requires some functional CSS, otherwise it won't work. If you build a custom theme, use the widget's specific CSS file as a starting point.</para>
